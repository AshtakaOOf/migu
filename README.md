# Migu

**Migu** is a fork of Miru that focused on mobile-first experience with added features and polished the experience by a mile.


## Unique Features (Changes from Miru)

### Limited Bandwidth Options
- **Prevent Mini Player Loading:** By default, the mini player does not load on startup resulting in less bandwidth usage (this can be toggled).
- **Separate Download and Upload Limits:** Allows setting different limits for downloading and uploading/

#### Why?
Mobile users often have limited bandwidth or data quotas. Miru can consume up to 1GB per 3 minutes upon startup, which is impractical for mobile users.
