# Migu

**Migu** is a fork of Miru that focused on mobile-first experience with added features. Designed to stream anime torrents, real-time with no waiting for downloads. Currently, there is no support for a PC version, but this may be considered in the future.

## Unique Features (Changes from Miru)

### Limited Bandwidth Options
- **Close Mini Player:** Option to close the mini player.
- **Prevent Mini Player Loading:** By default, the mini player does not load on startup (this can be toggled).
- **Separate Download and Upload Limits:** Allows setting different limits for downloading and uploading.
- **Disable Seeding:** Option to fully disable seeding.

#### Why?
Mobile users often have limited bandwidth or data quotas. Miru can consume up to 1GB per minute, which is impractical for mobile users.
