**Migu** is a fork of [Miru](https://github.com/ThaUnknown/miru/) that focused on better **mobile** experience with added features and polished the experience by a mile.


## Changes from Miru

### Limited Bandwidth Options
- **Prevent Mini Player Loading Upon Startup:** By default, the mini player does not load on startup resulting in less bandwidth usage (this can be toggled).
- **Separate Download and Upload Limits:** Allows setting different limits for downloading and uploading. Give user more control.

### Mobile Focused Fixes
- Amoled Theme
- Back button now function as back button (shocking I know)
- Statusbar now function as statusbar (shocking I know)
- Changing tabs will actually changing tab (shocking I know)
- Reclicking Now Playing tab will close the modal
- Play video on fullscreen by default instead of playing it in horizontal page


#### Why?
Mobile users often have limited bandwidth or data quotas. Miru can consume up to 1GB per 3 minutes upon startup due to miniplayer, which is impractical for mobile users[.](https://rentry.org/miguarg)
